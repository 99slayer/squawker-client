Squawker is my final project for The Odin Project. It aims to replicate the core functionality of Twitter.

Checkout the live preview! ðŸ‘‰ **[Squawker Live Demo](https://99slayer.github.io/squawker-client)**\
**The demo is hosted on a free [render](https://render.com/) instance, so the app may need around one minute to spin up due to inactivity.**

Checkout the back-end repo! ðŸ‘‰ **[Squawker-api](https://github.com/99slayer/squawker-api)**
